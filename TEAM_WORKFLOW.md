# ScholarForge Team Workflow Guide

## üèÜ Winning Strategy: Maximize Collaboration & Commits

### Phase 1: GitHub Issues Setup (Team Lead)
1. **Create all 12 issues** from `GITHUB_ISSUES.md` in your GitHub repo
2. **Assign issues** to teammates:
   - @mrslick8601: Issues #1, #5, #9
   - @RicheySon: Issues #2, #6, #10
   - @Samxury: Issues #3, #7, #11
   - @TechGuygh: Issues #4, #8, #12
3. **Set up branch protection** (require PR reviews)

### Phase 2: Team Collaboration (Each Teammate)

#### For Each Issue:
1. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/issue-1-language-hero-nfts
   ```

2. **Copy-paste the provided code** from `GITHUB_ISSUES.md`

3. **Commit with clear message:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add Language Hero NFT logic to SkillNFT

   - Add languageHero mapping and LanguageHeroMinted event
   - Implement mintLanguageHero function with role-based access
   - Add comprehensive validation and error handling
   
   Closes #1"
   ```

4. **Push and create PR:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/issue-1-language-hero-nfts
   ```
   - Use the PR template
   - Link to the issue
   - Assign a reviewer

5. **Review other PRs** (each teammate reviews at least 2 PRs)

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance

- [ ] Code compiles: `npx hardhat compile`
- [ ] Tests pass: `npx hardhat test`
